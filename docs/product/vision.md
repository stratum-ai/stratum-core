# Vision & Principles

## End State (3–5 years)
A widely adopted **semantic substrate** between agents and heterogeneous data estates:
- Universal, agent-native catalog (schemas, lineage, embeddings)
- NL→SQL/Polars planning with verification and governance
- Cross-backend execution + stitching (structured + vector)

## Principles
- **Neutrality**: Cloud/warehouse agnostic (no vendor lock-in).
- **Open formats**: Arrow/Parquet; Iceberg for tables where relevant.
- **Interfaces first**: Stable contracts for VectorStore, Connector, Planner, Verifier.
- **Security by default**: Read-only creds, verification, limits, audit logs.
- **OSS core**: Community-driven, premium connectors/governance sold separately.
