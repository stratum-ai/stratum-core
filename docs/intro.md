# Stratum Core (Open Source)

**Stratum** is the **agent-native, cloud-neutral semantic layer** for data + AI.

- **Catalog for agents**: crawl schemas, profile columns, generate NL descriptions, and embed metadata.
- **Semantic query bridge**: turn natural language into safe, verified SQL/Polars.
- **Neutral by design**: works with DuckDB/Postgres locally, and integrates with Snowflake/Databricks via premium connectors.

**Why now?**
Enterprises run Snowflake *and* Databricks *and* app DBs *and* vector DBs.
Agents fail without schema/lineage context and a cross-backend query bridge.
Stratum is the missing substrate.
